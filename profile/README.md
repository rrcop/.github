# Reproducible Research: Community of Practice

*Communities of Practice* are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.
The community acts as a **living curriculum** and involves **learning on the part of everyone**.
The [three characteristics](https://www.communityofpractice.ca/background/what-is-a-community-of-practice/) of a *CoP* are:

1. Community: An environment for learning through interaction;

2. Practice: Specific knowledge shared by community members; and

3. Domain: A shared interest, problem, or concern.

This Community of Practice is open to researchers who share an interest in **reproducible research and/or related topics and practices**.
This includes — but is not limited to — any interested persons across the
[SPECTRUM](https://www.spectrum.edu.au/) and [SPARK](https://www.spark.edu.au/) networks.
